# TOIF

The Tool Output Integration Framework (TOIF) is a powerful composite
vulnerability detection platform that automatically combines results
from separate code defect scanner tools into one common reporting format
and defect management platform.  TOIF normalizes and analyzes the results
of each tool to add weighting to defect reports, remove duplicates and assign
consistent Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) codes.   The management platform
 provides the list of defects, along with sorting by defect type and tool,
 weighting and action status (defect citing).
