sync_loop	Loop 999: invocation of synchronized method barMethod can cause deadlock
loop	Loop 999/999: invocation of method barMethod forms the loop in class dependency graph
lock	Lock fooString is requested while holding lock fooString, with other thread holding fooString and requesting lock fooString
wait	Method wait() can be invoked with monitor of other object locked
locklist	Holding 999 lock(s):fooString
wait_path	Call sequence to method barMethod can cause deadlock in wait()
nosync	Synchronized method barMethod is overridden by non-synchronized method of derived class 'CruftClass'
concurrent_call	Method barMethod can be called from different threads and is not synchronized
concurrent_access	Field 'uglyUTFstuff' of class 'CruftClass' can be accessed from different threads and is not volatile
run_nosync	Method barMethod implementing 'Runnable' interface is not synchronized
lock_assign	Value of lock uglyUTFstuff is changed outside synchronization or constructor
lock_assign2	Value of lock uglyUTFstuff is changed while (potentially) owning it
wait_nosync	Method 'fooString.uglyUTFstuff' is called without synchronizing on 'fooString'
not_overridden	Method barMethod is not overridden by method with the same name of derived class 'CruftClass'
equals_not_overridden	hashCode() was overridden but not equals()
hashcode_not_overridden	equals() was overridden but not hashCode()
field_redefined	Component 'uglyUTFstuff' in class 'CruftClass' shadows one in base class 'CruftClass'
shadow_local	Local variable 'uglyUTFstuff' shadows component of class 'CruftClass'
super_finalize	Method finalize() doesn't call super.finalize()
null_param	Method barMethod can be invoked with NULL as 999 parameter and this parameter is used without check for NULL
null_var	Value of referenced variable 'uglyUTFstuff' may be NULL
null_ptr	NULL reference can be used
zero_operand	Zero operand for fooString operation
zero_result	Result of operation fooString is always 0
shift_count	Shift fooString with count fooString than 999
shift_range	Shift fooString count range [999,999] is out of domain
conversion	Range of expression value has no intersection with fooString type domain
truncation	Data can be lost as a result of truncation to fooString
overflow	Maybe type cast is not correctly applied
same_result	Comparison always produces the same result
disjoint_mask	Compared expressions can be equal only when both of them are 0
no_effect	Reminder always equal to the first operand
short_char_cmp	Comparison of short with char
string_cmp	Compare strings as object references
weak_cmp	Inequality comparison can be replaced with equality comparison
incomp_case	Switch case constant 999 can't be produced by switch expression
neg_len	Array length [999,999] is less than zero
maybe_neg_len	Array length [999,999] may be less than zero
bad_index	Index [999,999] is out of array bounds
maybe_bad_index	Index [999,999] may be out of array bounds
done	Verification completed: 999 reported messages
