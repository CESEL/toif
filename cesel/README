This script is used to extract the details of a git repository to feed the statistical model in TOIF.

Requirements:
 python 2.7+
 python modules required:
  gitpython - pip install gitpython

You will need to run this script against a local copy of a git repository. 
Run the following command and replace the path_to_git_repo with the location of the repository:

    python gitex.py path_to_git_repo

Once completed, go to the folder path_to_git_repo/.git/cesel and copy this file to folder where you will run TOIF from
The modified TOIF should automatically detect the file containing the details to feed it's statistical model and will enable the filtering.
